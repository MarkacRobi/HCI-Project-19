We used glioma specific data from 18 different projects via 
https://pedcbioportal.kidsfirstdrc.org/study/summary?id=genie_chop%2Cpbta_all%2Ccptac_cbttc%2Clgg_tcga%2Cglioma_msk_2018%2Clgg_ucsf_2014%2Clgggbm_tcga_pub%2Csega_cbttc%2Cdipg_cbttc%2Cpbta_pnoc003%2Cglioma_baker_gse19578%2Cglioma_baker_gse26576%2Cgbm_tcga%2Cgnos_cbttc%2Cphgg_herby%2Cphgg_jones_meta_2017%2Cphgg_cbttc%2Cplgg_cbttc 

-> the download button at the right top only includes the clinical data such as age, but not the specific genomic data details.


Therefore, the following steps describe, how you get these "additional information": 

->You have to export the column "mutated genes" 
-> open the export and just take the column genes -> sort by mutation count 
-> take only those that have >= 2 mutations and then copy all the gene names and go back to the pedcbioportal link and make a query at the right top input with those gene names....
-> download mutation table at the download tab right
-> the table provides genes and their mutations also in percentage.

-> Since pedcbioportal allows to query for max 167 different gene IDs, we chose the 140 top mutated genes out of the summary of all 18 projects.
 These include mutation frequencies down to 2%.
