## Description   
In our project we will make use of a classification algorithm, extract features, identify feature 
sets and predict age classes according to these features. Furthermore we will find out what are typical feature levels for specific age‐based tumor disease classes and show the results of our experiments in a technical report.

## State-of-the-Art
Today there are a lot of databases available to get data of different cancer types. There have been different researches on cancer using AI for example “DeepGx: Deep Learning Using Gene Expression for Cancer Classification“ which tries to find out different cancer types according to different features. There is still a lot of progress left to be made here. 

## Plan
Obtain, process and format data 
Select relevant features using feature selection methods (Univariate Selection, Feature Importance, ..)
Organize data for training and validation
Set up a neural network for classification of age classes
Use LIME or LRP for explainable AI and find typical features
Visualize the results

## Technical stack
Python 3.6+
TensorFlow (Deep learning library for Python)
TensorBoard (visualization tool)
Expected results
Tool processing data, and by self‐learning providing age based tumor disease classes as well as reproducible description.
